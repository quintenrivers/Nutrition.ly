### What is a Food Drought?

Food drought is a phrase used to describe an area that has low access to fresh food from groceries. Unfortunately, this often another inconvenience that afflicts those that are in poverty. Nutrient.ly aims to make those families' lives easier by allowing individuals to donate money to open and maintain food banks in the counties of their choice.
